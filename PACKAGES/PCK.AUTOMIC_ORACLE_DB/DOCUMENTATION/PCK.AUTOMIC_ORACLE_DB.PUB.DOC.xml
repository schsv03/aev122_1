         <Docu><![CDATA[The database actions cover basic deployment scenarios around Oracle databases.

You can for example execute arbitrary SQL-scripts on your SQL server(s) like to run your migration scripts, DB schema creation script etc, using the generic runbook functions. The Oracle-runbook functions allow you to execute some basic, recurring tasks during deployments.

=Supported Databases= 

The runbook functions use standard SQL queries executed over a JDBC connection to the database. The following system was tested:

* Oracle 11g

=Setup=

* the JDBC driver jar files are not shipped with the Actions library. Download the appropriate JDBC driver (my-JDBC-driver.jar) matching to your database and put it on the executing agent host.

* define the path to your JDBC driver jar file in the variable 'JDBC Driver JAR URI'

* define the main driver class of your jar file. See your JDBC vendor's documentation for more details. 

* define the connection string in the property 'JDBC Connection String'. See your JDBC vendor's documentation for more details.

=Rollback=

The Oracle Database actions do not have rollbacks defined yet.
