         <Docu><![CDATA[These actions can be used to interact with the Automic Release Automation via its webservice to perform certain operations.

One can perform simple functions like start an activity, create an activty from an activitytemplate, assign a deploymentpackage, schedule the activity and start the activity.
We provide actions for every function and for some of the composite functions. These actions are written to be executed mainly from the Deployment Manager itself and not directly from within the AutomationEngine client. Therefore some settings are made directly in the variables tab and not via a PromptSet.

=Supported versions=

See http://docs.automic.com/compatibility?len=Package.DM&comp=PCK.AUTOMIC_DM&version=1.2.3

=Rollback=
